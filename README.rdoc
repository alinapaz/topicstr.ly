Topicstr.ly is a web app where you can add topics and their
descriptions, and then you can vote on them. On the main page,
http://electric-spring-9907.heroku.com/topics there's a list of
topics, a vote box and links on the topic names to see descriptions,
as well as a link to delete and add new topics. This is a test app
in my learning Rails 3.2.3 at the Railsbridge event on 3/31/2012 on
a most rainy San Francisco Saturday. My next goal is to build out
this app with some new features outside the basic curriculum.

Vote away!
